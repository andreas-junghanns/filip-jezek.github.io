Dassault Systèmes are delighted to announce that Dymola 2016 was released on May 29, 2015.

**Model development and simulation**
Dymola 2016 offers significant improvements for the model developer. Extended support for editing multiple models is provided by a new tabbed interface in the graphical editor, while an instance path indicator facilitates navigation within the model. Drag & drop in the package browser makes restructuring of model libraries faster.

Plotting of simulation results has been improved with a second vertical axis. Model debugging is supported by dependency information generated by Dymola, making it easier to see trace contributing quantities.

**Human Comfort Library**
Entering into a technology partnership with XRG Simulation, the Human Comfort Library is now available in the Dymola and 3DEXPERIENCE product portfolios. Suitable for automotive, aerospace and building applications, the library is used to estimate human comfort in an air-conditioned zone. Human Comfort Library provides:

-  Models of air conditioned zones and flow
-  Analysis and visualization of human comfort
-  Occupant activity and metabolism
-  Framework compatible with fluid and control models

**Functional Mockup Interface**
Improvements in Dymola enhance FMI compliance and improve the capability to simulate complex systems with multiple Functional Mockup Units (FMUs). Updated tools for Simulink &tm; support export of FMUs according to both FMI 1.0 and FMI 2.0. The new export functionality supports both Model Exchange and Co-Simulation, and in addition has many new features compared to the old version.
