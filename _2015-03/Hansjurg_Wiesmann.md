Hansjürg Wiesmann, 74, of Seegräben, Switzerland, passed away on August 22, 2015, as a result of a long struggle with a serious illness. We grieve the death of our beloved friend and Modelica Association member. Hansjürg was Senior Scientist at the ABB Research Center Baden, Switzerland during his professional career. Also after his retirement he made valuable contributions to Modelica. His research topics included Theoretical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Dielectrics, and modelling of complex systems, for which he took part in the Modelica initiative since 1996. Hansjürg made many considerable contributions to the Modelica community such as the Modelica SPOT library for electric power systems which in turn is the basis of the PowerSystems and the Electric Power Systems library. He also authored and co-authored numerous scientific Modelica papers. Hansjürg was an outstanding scientist, and also a loyal and reliable person, whose calm spirit and integrity were prized within our Modelica community. His contributions to a good discussion culture at the Modelica design meetings will be missed by all of us. He is an inspiration to us and future generations of engineers.
