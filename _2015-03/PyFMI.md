We are happy to announce the release of PyFMI 2.2! PyFMI comes with support for working with FMI 1.0 and 2.0, both Model-Exchange and Co-Simulation. With PyFMIâ€™s companion package Assimulo, FMUs are simulated with a wide range of quality integration algorithms, including CVode from the Sundials suite, Radau and Implicit/Explicit Euler.

For this release we are glad to announce the following highlights:

-  Compressed sparse calculation of the Jacobian that can substantially increase simulation performance
-  Sensitivity computation with respect to model parameters (requires that model parameter is set to an input)
-  Support for Python 3
