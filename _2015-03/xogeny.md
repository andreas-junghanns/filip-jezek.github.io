Xogeny is proud to announce that we will be demonstrating our latest tool, XenGen. XenGen is a tool that transforms FMI compliant models (FMUs) into web-based applications. Come see us on Monday, September 21st at 5:00pm in the "Colbert" room at the Modelica Conference.

One of the big advantages of XenGen is that it builds web-based applications based on information already contained in the FMUs. First, it leverages as much of the information already contained in an FMU as possible (min values, max values, defaults values, units, etc.). When additional information is required beyond what is normally provided by FMI, it leverages a simple and intuitive markup language to provide additional information and/or hints about how to display and manage data. In this way, model developers work with the tools they already know and no knowledge of HTML, Javascript or CSS is required to create these web applications.

With XenGen, model developers have a simple way to deploy and update their models. The main benefit of XenGen is that existing models can easily be transformed into web applications that can be used by many more users. By leveraging reactive design, these applications can be used on devices such as tablets and phones as well. This greatly expands the impact and reach of these models. This, in turn, means a much better return on the investment made in creating these models.

In addition to being a model deployment platform, XenGen is also a data management platform. It provides a complete data management solution for designs and simulation results. Furthermore, the underlying data management system is also a collaboration platform allowing users to exchange designs and results with each other as easily as sharing a simple hyperlink.

Xogeny will be demonstrating the XenGen application generator during the Xogeny vendor session. Please stop by and see XenGen in action.
